# RAYCA Evaluation Task

## Description

I have completed the first 4 steps of the evaluation task and was unable to conduct survival analysis in clusters.

## Installation Instructions
NOTE: currently tested using Python 3.12.4 on Apple Silicon

First and foremost, please make sure you have downloaded the correct packages using pip or pip3.
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install lifelines
pip install sklearn
```

Download the repository by using git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haesoljung04/RaycaEvalTask.git
```

Because the gene expression data I used was around 150MB, please download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHq4NinqiEocsDNet07irTY9SI7_58-g/view?usp=sharing) here and drag/drop it into the 'data' folder

Then you can test the code by first opening up this project directory. If you are in terminal you can simply run this command:
```bash
cd RaycaEvalTask
```

To run the code and all the scripts:
```bash
python main.py
```

All the relevant files and data used/generated are in the 'data' folder.
